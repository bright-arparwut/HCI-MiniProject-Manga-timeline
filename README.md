# Manga Publication Timeline Visualization

## About the Project
This project presents an interactive visualization of manga series publication timelines, developed as part of the coursework for a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class. It aims to explore and demonstrate effective HCI principles through the lens of data visualization, focusing on the rich history of manga publications.

### Background
Manga, or Japanese comic books, have a significant impact on global culture, offering a wide array of genres and themes. This visualization seeks to provide insights into the publication span, popularity, and demographics of various manga series, allowing users to interact with the data to uncover detailed information about each series.

### Objectives
- To apply HCI principles in designing an interactive data visualization.
- To enhance user understanding of manga publication history through interactive exploration.
- To analyze the impact of visualization techniques on user engagement and information retention.

## Features
- **Publication Timeline:** A Gantt-like chart representing the start and end of publication for each manga series.
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can hover over elements to reveal additional details, such as authors, sales figures, and demographic information.
- **Color Coding:** Distinct colors are used to differentiate between manga series, improving visual distinction.

## How to Use
1. Visit the project [website](#) or clone this repository to run it locally.
2. Explore the visualization by hovering over the bars to reveal details about each manga series.
3. Use the information presented to gain insights into manga publication trends and history.

## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- D3.js for data visualization
- Data sourced from publicly available manga sales information

## Project Insights and Reflection
This project highlights the importance of intuitive design and interaction in data visualization. By applying HCI principles, we aimed to create a user-friendly interface that not only informs but also engages users in exploring the dataset. Reflecting on user feedback and interaction data, we discuss the effectiveness of our design choices and potential areas for improvement.
